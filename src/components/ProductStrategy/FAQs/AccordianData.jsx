        Generally speaking, product strategy is a plan describing what a
        business product hopes to accomplish and how. This roadmap of your
        product development allows you to settle your vision, gather research
        about your audience and the market, prepare an adequate design, work on
        it hassle-free, and test the solution. It is a step-by-step journey that
        covers the whole process of releasing your product.

        A solid product strategy helps to translate your idea to future users,
        gather research that will position your project on the market, and make
        sure that your business goals are met according to a simple and
        understandable workflow. Having a well-defined product strategy allows
        you to plan the release, gather the funds and partners, strategise your
        product on foreign markets and scale on local ones. Thanks to a thorough
        product strategy, your team can improve the decision making and
        understand which tasks to prioritise for the maximum efficiency of the
        work process.

        The main advantage of a well-defined product strategy is that it can be
        adjusted and applied to every stage of your process. Surely, it would be
        more beneficial for your project vision if your business plan was
        prepared before moving on to the development stage. However, since every
        work process is prone to changes and unexpected adjustments, having an
        agile product strategy could save you some headaches. At codeFulcrum, we
        usually divide our clientsâ€™ strategies into specific milestones, so that
        you could clearly see how we develop your project from step one to the
        post-release stage.

        First of all, you should understand that product strategy is subject to
        change even in the most rigid projects. Since its primary goal is to
        help you set the correct SMART goals, a good product strategy has to
        come prior to any other stage of the development process. Further on,
        there are many variables that can affect the time it will take to create
        the first draft of a viable product strategy. Key project elements such
        as the product itself, your budget, tech requirements, etc. can all
        affect the time it will take to prepare the roadmap. As a rule, there
        are defined stages of working on the product strategy. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discovering your agenda</li>

        <li>Shaping your product vision</li>

        <li>Defining product goals</li>

        <li>Creating a goal-based roadmap</li>
        <li>Repeated review and modifications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At codeFulcrum, we work according to Scrum iterations, meaning that each
        cycle of work takes between 1 and 2 weeks, depending on the team. If you
        require assistance solely with the business aspect of a product
        strategy, you can count on a faster completion of the entire process.
        However, we recommend trusting our team with the entire product
        development.{" "}
