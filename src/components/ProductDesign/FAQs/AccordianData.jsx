        Having a proper design can make a mediocre product seem outstanding,
        while a poorly executed vision can destroy even the greatest idea.
        Design is fundamentally important when it comes to competition, price
        and product placement. This is true about the absolute majority of
        products nowadays, but the term “product design” holds a very special
        place in the web and mobile development industry in particular.

        Product design is the process of developing a new product to meet
        customer needs and solve problems. It encompasses both the
        identification of customer needs and problem-solving, as well as
        ideating on how the product would work. Therefore, it is not just about
        creating an attractive look for your application. Product design,
        encompassing both user experience and user interface design, is
        responsible for addressing the app’s functionality and potential. As
        such, it refers to the complex process of strategising, defining key
        goals, researching the market, creating prototypes, and testing their
        effectiveness.

        User experience design is the process of designing products that are
        user-friendly and enjoyable to interact with. Thanks to UX, brands hope
        to enhance the experience customers have with their product. This
        generates higher value and results in a better customer journey. The
        term is equally applicable to both physical and digital products.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good UX design takes into account all the aspects of a product that
        might be important to a potential user. Design features like usability,
        accessibility, and appeal are all taken into account when crafting a
        piece of interactive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to build an application with a great UX design, designers,
        developers and marketers need to empathize with the customer and do
        their best for their product to reflect on the most common problems that
        may occur in their lives and provide effective solutions.

        Often confused with UX, UI design is simply a graphical layout of a
        product. This term is more common among developers, since user interface
        design refers to the process of building interfaces for computerized
        devices. UI design consists of the screen layout, transitions, clickable
        buttons on the page, the text and image positioning, and the rest of the
        items a user can interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important features of a good UI design are usability,
        predictability, and likeability – people want these designs to be
        intuitive and their experience to be seamless. Think about why most
        logos are located in the top-left corner of a web page. Furthermore, the
        user interface needs to clearly communicate brand identity and value.

        Simply put, UI design is an essential component of a more complex UX
        design process. Both user interface and user experience primarily focus
        on improving overall customer satisfaction with a product and,
        consequently, a brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while UX relates to the overall interaction and experience
        users have with a product and often requires detailed understanding of
        customer behaviour, UI is dedicated to specific assets of the same
        product, like colours or typography.
